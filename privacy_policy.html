        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 22, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to our applications (the "Services"), provided by us ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy
            explains how information is handled when you use our Services.</p>

        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. We want to be transparent about the data involved when you use
            our Services.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect Directly</h2>
        <p>Our Services are designed to respect your privacy. <strong>We do not directly collect any personally
                identifiable information (PII) from you through the Services themselves.</strong> This means we do not
            collect information such as your name, email address, phone number, physical address, photos, or contacts
            directly.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
        <p>While we do not collect data directly, our Services use Google AdMob, a third-party advertising service
            provided by Google, to display advertisements. AdMob helps us keep our Services available, often free of
            charge.</p>
        <p>AdMob may collect and use certain data to provide personalized advertising and measure ad performance. This
            data may include, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Such as your device model, operating system version, unique device
                identifiers (like the Advertising Identifier - IDFA on iOS), and mobile network information.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the ads shown in the Services
                (e.g., clicks, views, time spent).</li>
            <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> General location information (e.g., country or city) may be
                inferred from your IP address or provided if location services are enabled for advertising purposes on
                your device.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your Internet Protocol address.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected and processed by Google AdMob according to their own privacy policies. We do not have
            direct access to or control over the specific data collected by AdMob or how they use it.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to review Google's privacy policies to understand how they handle your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
                    target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Google Ad Technology Information:</strong> <a
                    href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads"
                    target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
            <li><strong>How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services:</strong> <a
                    href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites"
                    target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How Information Collected by AdMob is Used</h2>
        <p>The data collected by Google AdMob is primarily used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve relevant and personalized advertisements to you within the Services.</li>
            <li>Measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</li>
            <li>Improve AdMob's services.</li>
            <li>Detect and prevent fraud and ensure security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Choices Regarding Advertising</h2>
        <p>You may have options to limit personalized advertising on your iOS device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Tracking Transparency (ATT):</strong> On iOS 14.5 and later, apps are required to ask for
                your permission before tracking your activity across other companies' apps and websites for advertising
                purposes. You can manage these permissions in your device's Settings under Privacy & Security >
                Tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit Ad Tracking (Older iOS versions) / Personalized Ads (Newer iOS versions):</strong> You may
                be able to opt-out of interest-based advertising through your device settings. Check under Settings >
                Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising > Personalized Ads (turn off). Instructions may vary slightly
                depending on your iOS version.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that opting out may not stop all advertising, but it may make the ads you see less relevant to
            your interests.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>While we do not collect your personal data directly, we rely on Google AdMob to implement appropriate
            technical and organizational measures to protect the data they collect. However, please be aware that no
            method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy (e.g., within the application or on our website). You are advised to review this Privacy
            Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>
